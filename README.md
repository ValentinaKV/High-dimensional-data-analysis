# High-dimensional-data-analysis

There are two datasets containing pictures of cats and dogs. The pictures are stored as text in the CSV files. The files contain a matrix with 4096 rows and 80 columns. Each column is a single pet and each value of the columns shows brightness of a pixel. Examples of images are shown below:

In this work you can find visualization of the high dimensional data on 2 and 3 dimensional space using PCA and t-SNE. Examples of the 2D charts are shown below, other charts you can see in pets.ipynb
